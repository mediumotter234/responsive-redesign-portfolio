    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <p>
    I picked a website which I thought was poorly-designed and <a href="https://mediumotter234.github.io/responsive-redesign/">redesigned</a> one of its pages based on principles of usability and 
    accessibility.
    The website I picked was <a href="https://www.patientvoting.com/howtovote">this one</a> because I felt that it contained a lot of important, 
    relevant information but is poorly designed and as a result, probably reaches less people than it could.
    The websiteâ€™s aim is to give the reader information on how to vote given different circumstances they may be in, in the
    context of hospitalized patients.
    </p>

    <h3>
        ISSUES
    </h3>
    
    The current website has a bunch of usability issues, including an <b>unorganized conceptual model</b>, lots of <b>redundant information</b>,
    and <b>poor ease of navigation</b> for the user.
    <br>
    <br>
    Issue #1: There isn't a clear distinction between different use cases for users. The "find your state" button should
    be differentiated from the other scenario buttons, and it isn't super obvious for a first-time user what to actually do with these
    scenario buttons.
    <br> <br>
    Issue #2: Many links go to the same repeated information, especially in the menu bar. For example, there is a 
    "States" option in the menu bar, but it links to a section on the current How to Vote page that contains three repetitive ways
    of picking a state.
    <br> <br>
    Issue #3: The webpage is really long but only offers easy navigation from the top, and also doesn't indicate 
    to the user that automatic scrolling movement will happen when clicking the buttons rather than just a direct trip to the link destination.
    <br>
    <br>
    From the WebAIM WAVE test, more issues were discovered, primarily with contrast as well as underlined, non-link text.
    I thought these issues were fair as I had personally noticed the contrast being tough on the eyes, so WAVE helped quantify
    it as an actual accessibility issue. The underlined text not being a link is also something which
    makes sense being an accessibility issue.
    <h3>
        LOFI WIREFRAMES
    </h3>
    
    Here are three annoted lo-fi wireframes I made for the re-designed website, one for each of desktop, mobile, and tablet:

            <figcaption><b>DESKTOP</b></figcaption>
        <img src="Desktop Wireframe.png" height="500" width="700">
        
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <figcaption><b>MOBILE</b></figcaption>
        <img src="Mobile Wireframe.png" height="500" width="700">
        
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <figcaption><b>TABLET</b></figcaption>
        <img src="Tablet Wireframe.png" height="500" width="700">
       
        </figure>

    <h3>REDESIGNED WEBSITE</h3>
    Here is the <a href="https://mediumotter234.github.io/responsive-redesign/">redesigned website</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    A quick summary of the things I changed:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Altered color theme for better contrast (according to WAVE)
        </li>
        <li>
            Added clearer indicator of movement on button hovers
        </li>
        <li>
            Removed redundant information on page and in menu buttons
        </li>
        <li>
            Made use cases and direction of webpage clearer 
        </li>
        <li>
            Added sticky sidebar for ease of full page navigation
        </li>
        <li>
            Added more responsiveness to screen size, font size, etc.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>TAKEAWAYS</h3>
    Thoroughly examining the original website and using the WAVE tool helped lay the groundwork for the changes I made to the website. 
    Since I had a concrete conceptual model in my mind to work off of, the redesign was simply following the guidelines
    that the model defines. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of how even the smallest of design changes can strongly affect usability and accessibility
    of a website.
